	  		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	  		<p>Playersync's Privacy Policy covers what information we collect and how that information is used through the user experience.</p>
	  		<h3>What information does Playersync collect?</h3>
	  		<p>Playersync collects user information you provide as you use the application.  Actions such as creating a profile, adding or inviting friends, finding local things to do and engaging in conversations all contribute user data to Playersync.  Your name, age, gender, profile photo, pictures, videos, email address, and contacts are all common pieces of data Playersync collects to create a meaningful experience where you can connect around what you love to most.  When you connect with Facebook, your login credentials, general profile data and contacts are also collected.</p>
	  		<p>Playersync also automatically collects your location via GPS coordinates to display the most local and relevant people, places and happenings for you to get involved with.  Once your Playersync account is set up and you begin to use the service, Playersync collects session data to determine what you like to do and where you like to do it, so it can match you up with the most relevant people, places and events.  Playersync may also use this behavioral data to present local deals and prizes that best match who you are.</p>

	  			<h3>Playersync third party (non-affiliated) sites</h3>
	  			<p>The Playersync site may contain links to third party (non-affiliated) web sites not associated with Playersync. We provide these links to enhance your experience. Playersync is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such outside sites, however. Users will need to review the policy statements of each individual third party site to understand their specific privacy policies.</p>
	  			
	  			<h3>Data Protection and Security</h3>
	  			<p>Playersync takes good, responsible measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. It is the user's responsibility to protect the security of their login and personal contact information. Playersync uses servers located in data security hubs. Firewalls and other advanced security technologies are employed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
	  			
	  				  			
	  			<h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
	  			<p>Over time, policies are amended. Playersync reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. Any substantial changes to this policy will be posted online and accessible via the Playersync website and/or email thirty days prior to taking effect. The majority of notifications will come via alerts displayed upon login.</p>
